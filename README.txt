Hi , i have completed the tasks as defined below 



Code to refactor
=================
1) app/Http/Controllers/BookingController.php has refactored 
2) app/Repository/BookingRepository.php has refactored top 2 methods 

Code to write tests (optional)
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt written test in JobHelperTest
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate


----------------------------
The code appeared to be functional but lacked proper comments and structure, making it harder to understand at first glance. It also had an inconsistency in handling the $noramlJobs variable, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
To enhance optimization, consider optimizing the use of roles and privileges. Additionally, it's recommended to define distinct methods for each role-related user action.


Indeed, dividing the code in a Booking repository into multiple files and creating separate helper files for common methods is a good approach to enhance code organization and maintainability. This practice can lead to improved readability and better code structure.

By creating separate files for different functionalities and grouping related methods together, the codebase becomes more modular and easier to manage. For instance, you could have a file for common helper methods, another for booking-related functions, and potentially more for any other logical divisions. This way, the codebase becomes more maintainable, and it's easier to find and reuse common functionalities.

Remember to also follow best practices in naming and organizing the files and methods, which can further enhance code clarity and collaboration among developers working on the project.

Thank you!
